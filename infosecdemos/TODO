 * Airmon management:
	- Need to manage turning on/off of monitor mode and choosing 
	  mon0 appropriately

 * Password Cracking:
	- Add brute force cracking
	- Show something like kHash/s for brute force
	- Add other cracking techniques?

 * Device name capture:
	- faster way of getting device list

 * Generic panels and panel mixins:
	- Generic list output panel
	- Generic threaded subprocess mixin

 * Could even go so far as to make XML/JSON/whatever based "description"
	files, something like:

	panels = [
		{
		"name":	"DDoS simulation",
		"spawnthreads": [
			{
				"exec": "scripts/attacker.py",
				"stdout": "None",
				"stderr": "None",
			}, 
			{
				"exec": "scripts/target.py",
				"stdout": "... output filter ...",
				...
			}
			]
			...
		},
		...
	]

	... this might turn out to be just as much hassle (or more!) as
	just doing things programmatically from the getgo.
